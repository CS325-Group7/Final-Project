To run the program:
	Type: 
		make
	Then type:
		./tsp <filename>
	The final path length will be printed to the screen. Open the <filename>.tour to see the final path length 
	printed to the top of the file along with the distances that were taken.

	NOTE: when using the ./tsp filename method, the final distance matches up with the solution provided 
	within the python verifier. When running the verifier, the computed distance is slightly off. But the
	algorithm does compute the same exact distance without the verifier.
